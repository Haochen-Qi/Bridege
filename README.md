# Bridge Pavement Defect Datasets
## Instruction
  Hello and welcome to my GitHub! I'm excited to introduce you to two unique datasets - **BridgeDefX** and **BridgeDef20** - which center around the much-needed area of bridge pavement defect segmentation. 

  As highlighted in my recently submitted academic paper, there's a significant lack of public datasets dedicated to bridge pavement defects. To fill this void, I've embarked on creating these two distinct collections. 

  BridgeDefX focuses on motor vehicle lanes on bridges, primarily involving asphalt and cement. On the other hand, BridgeDef20 zeros in on non-motorized lanes, particularly those made with granite blocks. In contrast to the current open-source pavement defect datasets, which are predominantly focused on a single type of defect—namely, cracking—BridgeDefX and BridgeDef20 stand apart by encompassing a far more diverse range of defects. 

  Specifically, BridgeDefX features **eight** distinct types of defects: **expansion joint deterioration, alkali-silica reaction, fatigue cracking, freeze-thaw damage, utility cut failures, block cracking, potholes, and rutting**. Meanwhile, BridgeDef20 ventures beyond the norm with **six** unique types of defects: **edge chipping, cracking, impact craters, patching, surface spalling, and corner fractures**. 

  Notably, while some defects are unique to bridge pavements, others may be found on both bridge and regular pavements, but are potentially more severe on bridges due to unique environmental and loading conditions. I've ensured both these datasets cover a wide range of common bridge pavement defects through extensive surveys.

  At the moment, you'll find a few sample entries from both datasets here on my GitHub page. These examples should give you a glimpse of the valuable information these collections encompass. 

  I look forward to making the full datasets available **after the publication of my academic paper**. This upcoming release will significantly amplify the depth and scope of resources available here for fellow researchers and practitioners in the field.

  I invite you to explore these samples, and keep an eye out for the full release. I'm confident these datasets will provide valuable insights and contribute significantly to the community. Happy exploring!
